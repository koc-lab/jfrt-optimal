# Optimal Filtering Comparison with Synthetic Data (Abandoned)

In order to compare the results of optimal filtering task on synthetic dataset with median filtering approach, this part is created. However, due to the fact that in the initial setup, only auto-correlation of the joint time-vertex signal is generated, and it is not necessarily positive definite for the selected graph topology, the auto-correlation cannot be Cholesky decomposable, which is needed for comparison with ARMA graph and median filtering approaches.
