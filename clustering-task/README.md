# Clustering Task

The main file is [`demo_mesh_clustering.m`](./demo_mesh_clustering.m), which is used for collecting data for clustering experiment. The plotting step can be achieved by the scripts under `plots_clustering/`. The `DFT` and `GFT` results are obtained with $(\alpha,\beta) = (1,0)$ and $(0, 1)$ respectively, which needs editting to the source code to variables `tim` and `gim`.
